What I did to create the repo:
1. Created the empty repo in github.
2. Clone the empty repo to my local box.
3. Run dotnet new console
4. Run dotnet run -- This should run the code and print out "Hello World!"
4. Copy the Program.cs code from the exercise template directory to the Program.cs in the project.
